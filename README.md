This part of the project entails choosing a dataset and formulating a set of analysis that could give some insight into the chosen dataset.
The chosen dataset recorded the police stops under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968) which is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. 
This is to guide police officers when making stops to search a suspect who has committed, is committing or is about to commit a crime. 
As shown in figure 1, the dataset contains the demographics of the suspect and officer involved. 
This is done to aid employment purposes when background check is done on an applicant. 
Over a period of years, the analysis will give an insight into how police stops and searches are conducted across suspects races, and the time periods those stops took place.
